          <p class="body-text">Happy Birthday my man! This site is the first website that I have created in my life and I thought that it would be a great idea to celebrate your Birthday like this.I know this doesn't sound like a Birthday gift so I am going to be getting you something else but this site is something that I can show you my gratitude for the past year. Since I don't really have any friends you're the one that actually stick to me and didn't really judge me so thank you for that.I know I look kinda dumb right now writing this text but this is really how I feel about you and yea... I don't really know anything else to write I'm really bad at this but I hope you enjoy the rest of the page.</p>
